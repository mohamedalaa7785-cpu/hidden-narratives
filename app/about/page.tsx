      <h1>About Hidden Narratives</h1>

      <p>
        Hidden Narratives is an independent digital media project dedicated to
        uncovering the hidden, controversial, and forgotten chapters of history.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through cinematic storytelling, research-based scripts, and AI-assisted
        production, the platform presents alternative perspectives and deep
        historical analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is to challenge surface-level narratives and encourage
        critical thinking through powerful storytelling.
